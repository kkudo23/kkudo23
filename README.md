- 👀 I’m interested in the complexities of cyberspace operations, with a particular focus on areas such as advanced network security protocols, AI-driven threat detection systems, and the ethical implications of cybersecurity measures. My interest also extends to exploring the interplay between cybersecurity and emerging technologies like blockchain and quantum computing, and how these can be leveraged to strengthen cyber defenses.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursueing a Doctor of Engineering in Cybersecurity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on innovative cybersecurity projects, particularly those focused on network security, data protection, and threat intelligence. I am keen on contributing to open-source projects and research initiatives that push the boundaries of our understanding and capabilities in cyberspace.
